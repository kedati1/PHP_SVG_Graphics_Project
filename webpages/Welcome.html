        <p>
            This is an SVG Graphic, and SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphic. <br>SVG's are designed to provide
            Vector graphics with the ability to be interacted with by code.<br> In this SVG, I have javascript make it look like the box is
            moving across the screen and once it reaches a certain point, it changes colour.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img id="boxImg" src="../assets/box.svg" alt="its a box" width="200" height="200"/>
        <p>This is the same SVG Graphic but it is being read from an Asset folder that stores the SVG.
            As you can see, the image is able to be interacted with just as successfully as if I was directly feeding in the SVG code.

        <h1 style="color:fuchsia";> Why Use SVG? </h1>
        <p style="color:fuchsia;font-size:20px;"> As displayed in these examples, <br />
        SVG's allow for the user to manipulate images effectively using Javascript while not losing out on any of the quality the image provides.<br />
        SVG images are very useful for designs that require images that can be easily scaled. This is for products like posters, leaflets or even Logo's.<br />
        By having the image retain it's quality, they can be very flexible for their uses and maintain a high standard for whatever purpose they're needed for.<br />
        Although these images age great for scalable situations, they are not good for situations where the image needs to be as accurately presented as it was taken. <br />
        The alternative type of image (bitmap) is designed to keep as high quality as possible when it comes to presenting the image in their raw format.<br />
        This is done by the image presenting itself with pixels. If the image gets modified in size, the pixels get either removed, shrunk or stretched to meet the size requirement, but lose out on thier quality as a price.<br />
        SVG's use coordinates to display thier images, which allow them to be scalable as they're not needed for their quality. This allows them to be resized as the coordinates would automatically get adjusted to meet the new size criteria.  </p>
